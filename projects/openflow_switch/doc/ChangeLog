v1.0.0 - 12 Mar 2010
--------------------
    - Added supported actions on NetFPGA:
       In addition to dst/src MAC addresses rewrite,
       VLAN ID, VLAN PCP, dst/src IP addresses, IP TOS, dst/src UDP/TCP
       ports rewrite with IP and UDP/TCP checksum recalculation are now
       supported. Packets with IP options are supported.
    - Expand one entry field for IP TOS matching.
    - Added capability of ARP fields matching.

v0.9.0 - 04 Aug 2009
--------------------
    - Adapted to NetFPGA package 2.0
    - Added supported action on NetFPGA:
       dst/src MAC address rewrite
    - Added entry key
       It parses all the eleven tuples including VLAN priority bits,
       supported on OpenFlow 0.9.0
    - Improved SLICE usage efficiency
       New fallthrough_small_fifo is now used in bram output_queues module
    - Supported Link status checking
       done by "nf2_download"'s argument. Add "-r" option to activate it.
        e.g.   nf2_download -r openflow_switch
    - Fixed bug
       * Deadlock happened when transmitting continuous small packets because
         input_fifo size on output_port_lookup was large
         -> Adjusted the fifo size
         (Reported and fixed by NetFPGA-OpenFlow user.)
